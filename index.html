        <p>Hi! My name is Sofie :-) I need to cross the rode and get to my Grandmother's home. <br>
            I cannot do this by my-self because there are bugs everywhere and I'm so afraid of them. <br>
            I also lost the key to my Grandmother's home... :-( and I cannot find it. If I don't get it, I will not get inside.<br>

            ..but you are so smart and clever ..would you help me?</p>
            <p>Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to help me cross the rode and avoid meeting with the bugs.</p>
            <p>When you will be ready, click the button.</p>
        <p class="start-button">Start the game</p>
